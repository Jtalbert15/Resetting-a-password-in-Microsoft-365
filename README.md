Now we can select the options we want to use. For us we are going to automatically create a password. We want to require the user to change their password so we no longer know their username and password. Finally we do want the email regarding the login information in case we need to reference it again.

Once all are selected click Reset password

We can document the password down and give the information to the user

Now if something goes wrong and the user or yourself doesn't have the credentials we can look in our outlook email

Lets do that now. Navigate to your outlook.

Now we can once again give the user access information in case the first attempt was unsuccesful
